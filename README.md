Self-Introduction

üëã Hello, I'm Chen Jiawei, a scholar passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and philosophy. I not only navigate the depths of computer technology but also seek wisdom in the halls of Marxist fundamental principles.

üéì My academic journey has spanned multiple fields, from the School of Management at Capital Normal University to the School of Computer Science at Beihang University, and back to the School of Marxism at Capital Normal University. Each transition has been an expansion of my boundaries. I hold dual master's degrees in Marxist Fundamental Principles and Computer Technology, and I am currently pursuing a doctorate in Marxist Fundamental Principles.

üìö My research interests are broad, focusing not only on cutting-edge technology topics such as blockchain and the metaverse, but also exploring the convergence of these technologies with social issues like ideological and political education and rural economic development. I believe that the integration of technology and social science will open new doors to our world.

üìù In terms of academic achievements, I have published papers in various international conferences and domestic journals. Here is a partial list of my publications:
